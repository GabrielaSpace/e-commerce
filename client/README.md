## Aurum Store :gem: :ring:
 
This is an online store project built using the MERN Full Stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Users can search, view product details, add products to the shopping cart, and filter by relevance, price, and alphabetically. The project consists of four main views: Home, Favorites, Cart, and DetailsProduct. MongoDB is used as the database and Mongoose is used to interact with it. Mongoose provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for performing CRUD operations on the database.


**Features and Endpoints:** 


*Home:* In the Home view, there is a search bar and three filters that sort products in descending and ascending order by Relevance, Price, and Alphabetical.

*Favorites*: Users can view their saved favorite products and add or remove them from the list as desired.

*Cart:*  Users will have the products they have added to their cart displayed, including the quantity and the total amount. They will also be able to remove items from their cart.

*Product Details:*  Users can save their favorite products, store them in the cart, and view details of each product such as description, relevance, price, and manufacturer's information.
